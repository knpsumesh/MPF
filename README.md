Do all the basic config in devices include route

Assume 200.10.10.1 is R2
Assume 192.168.1.1 is R1
* Create telnet in R2 and access it from R1 . its work 
* Ping R1to R2 its not work

# #f03c15 ERROR:
(suppose we ping from R1 to R2 its fail. Return traffic is blocked in fw becz connection table not store the traffic . normally we enable icmp,we can use another methode)

FW
```
Access-list myacl permit icmp any any
Class-map my class
Match access-list myacl
Exit
Policy-map mypolicy
Class myclass
Inspect icmp
Police input 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop

```
# Now I want to apply this in interface not globally

    Service-policy my policy interface outside


# we want to allow the icmp reply from outside to inside‚Äù

Now ping from R1 to R2 its work :

Check service-policy
